Description:-

    For our Senior Design class, we made an app to keep an eye on your garden plants, similar to a plant journal. Within this
    digital journal, gardeners can meticulously record plant-related information, including health status, watering schedules,
    and sunlight preferences. The primary goal of this app is to help users maintain their plants’ schedule, strengthen their
    connection with their gardens, and enhance their gardening knowledge by capturing progress photos and documenting their
    plant journey in a personal journal. Gardener’s Best Friend aims to enhance the interaction that gardeners have with their
    plants, providing users with tools to improve the overall wellness of their gardens.


How it works:-

    Firstly, you will need Android Studio to open the program.
    
    As you run the program, the emulator with a virtual android phone will open the app. The home screen have the following
    options:
        Green Earth as home AKA Home button.
        Diary button for all the plants you have already added.
        Hour glass as History button for old deleted plants.
        Add Plant button to add any new plants.
    
    When you click on Add Plant button, it will take you to a new page where the app will ask for your plant photo, name, days
    to select to water weekly, and description. After filling out all the information, you can hit confirm.

    Now you can see you newly added plant in your journal/diary by clicking Diary button. You can click on your newly added 
    plant and you will see all the information you have added. You can click on the pencil near your plant picture to edit your
    plant or add new entry or change anything else including picture.

    When you click on your plant in diary tab, with all the information you have added, you will also see additional
    information. That comes from an API we used from Perenual. Their API takes information fron their database and sends
    it to the app.
    
    Similarly, you can add more plants, update them, set water reminders, etc. and keep an eye on your garden plants. We have
    made the app very user friendly for you to not get confused.


Technology Used:-
    
    Android Studio
    Kotlin programming language
    SQLite
    Plant API fron Perenual
    GitHub


Trials and Tribulations:-

    We had difficulty implementing the pop-up menus for creating/removing playlists and adding/removing a song to/from a playlist. We
    also had difficulty implementing the progress bar. Our UML was semi-difficult.
    
    We have used two design patterns:
        Factory Design Pattern
        Composite Design Pattern
    
    
Bugs and Future plans:-

    There is a bug in the progress bar. It is not fully implemented. We have 90% of the logic ready but the last 10% is not implemented
    yet. Two other features that are not implemented are the current duration, and the audio art.
    
    For future, we are planning to have non-implemented things to be working properly.
    
    Our future plans for this project include a better user interface, importing personalized playlists from iTunes, an equalizer, a
    visualizer, a timer, and more audio extensions.
